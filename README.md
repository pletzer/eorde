# eorde

A VTK based app that displays contours on the Earth

Eorde (old anglo-saxon for Earth) has a limited number of external dependencies. These are 
 * Python (3.7+)
 * numpy 
 * netCDF4
 * vtk (tested with 8.2)

All these dependencioes can be easily installed with conda.

There is no graphical user interface - you interact with the mouse (zoom, rotation and translation). To read the next time step just type "t".
